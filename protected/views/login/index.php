                <h2>BROADCAST YOUR LISTINGS LIVE!</h2>
                <p>
                MRT is an app that allows you to broadcast live or pre-recorded videos of your listings. Whether you’re looking to show a client a new place or whether you’re trying to show another agent a property, MRT is the only tool you need to get the job done. Perhaps your client is out of town, or perhaps your client lives in another area and wants a better look at a property, we’ve got you covered.

                <h2>VIDEO IS WORTH A MILLION WORDS!</h2>
                <p>
                You’ve heard the saying, “a picture is worth a thousand words”. That’s true and great, but what’s even better than a picture? That’s right, video. These days videos are the standard when it comes to getting a good picture of some thing or some place. If a picture’s worth a thousand words, a video is worth a million words. So stop shuffling through pictures and get with the video!
