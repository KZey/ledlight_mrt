				<b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br/>

				WEB MEDIA TAKES PRIVACY SERIOUSLY. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the Sites (as defined below), including by both consumers and real estate professionals (real estate professionals including, without limitation, agents, providers of moving-related services, products or information, homebuilders, lenders, brokers, remodelers, home service professionals and other non-consumer service professionals, are referred to as “Professionals”). Except as otherwise indicated, Professionals, consumers and other persons using the Sites are individually and collectively referred to as “you”, and Web Media, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates are referred to as, “Web Media”, “we”, “us” and “our.” We use the Sites to provide you with information, resources, tools, products and services specific to the real estate industry and related markets, and to provide you with information about us and our advertisers, and our respective products and services.
				<br/>
				The Web Media family of Web sites operated on behalf of Web Media (the “Site(s)”) are committed to implementing policies and procedures designed to protect your privacy and security, in addition to providing you with the best possible online experience. To that end, we want you to understand what kinds of information we gather about you, how this information, particularly Personal Information (defined below), is used and safeguarded, and how you can control its use.  In conjunction with this Privacy Policy, you should also review our Terms of Use for a more complete understanding of the rules governing our Sites. 
                <br/><br/>

				<b>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM ME?</b><br/>

				Information You Give Us: Information collected from you will vary, depending on how you use the Sites and what information you may choose to provide to us (whether through email or otherwise). It may be possible to browse various sections of the Sites without submitting any personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) means individually identifiable information about you that we collect online, including, but not limited to, your full name, a user name and password, email address, phone number, physical address, or, for certain products or services, your social security number, or financial information, and for certain e-commerce transactions your credit card information. Information in a form that is aggregated with other information so as not to be reasonably identifiable with you, and information in a form that otherwise is detached, combined, organized, segmented, modified or processed so as not to be reasonably capable of being associated with you, will not be considered Personal Information, and will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy as to use, sharing or otherwise. If you choose to take advantage of some of our products and/or services, or to access certain of our tools or Site functionality, you may be asked to provide Personal Information. For certain Professionals, you may also be requested to provide your license or MLS ID#. Whenever we ask for Personal Information, we strive to provide a link to this Privacy Policy to help you understand how Personal Information will be used before you decide whether to disclose it. You can choose not to provide us with Personal Information, but then you may not be able to fully take advantage of certain features of our Sites and we may not be able to provide you with certain requested information, products and/or services.
				<br/>

				Automatic Collection of Information: Like many Web sites on the Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you visit and use our Sites to help us (i) better understand, improve and modify the Sites, (ii) better understand how the Sites are used and experienced and (iii) better understand how we can enhance your or others overall experience on one or more of the Sites, including providing advertising and other information that is relevant to you. This tracked or automatically gathered information may include, among other things, your computer’s IP address (Internet Protocol address), the URLs and Site pages you’ve visited, sections of or content on Site pages on which you click or in which you are interested, the number of times you visit each Site page, what downloads and/or search queries you have made, how long you spent on particular sections of each Site and on each Site generally, and your browser type. This automatically gathered data includes information provided through the use of “cookies” (which is described in more detail below).
				<br/>

				Information from Cookies: Cookies are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we can recognize it as a unique machine the next time you visit the Sites. You are always free to decline any cookies we use if your browser permits. Some of our advertisers and third-party service providers may also utilize their own cookies. In addition, we and our service providers sometimes use “clear GIFs” in connection with cookies and other website functions. Clear GIFs perform administrative functions without detracting from your online experience. They may be used to perform statistical and administrative tasks including measuring site and page traffic, verifying advertising avenues and positioning images on the web. Clear GIFs are not designed to collect Personal Information. 
			<br/><br/><br/>

				<b>INFORMATION SHARING DISCLOSURE - HOW IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME USED AND SHARED?</b><br/><br/>

				The use of information about you depends on the context in which it is collected. Therefore, pay special attention to the categories below that relate to the features of the Sites that you wish to utilize.
				<br/><br/>

				Personal Information: We may share the Personal Information we collect from you only with your consent or under the following circumstances.
				<br/><br/>

				User-Requested Services and Information: Certain features, products or services on our Sites may seek Personal Information from you, which may be used in the following ways: For information, features, products and services provided by the Sites, the information you submit is used by us to provide the information, feature, product or service you've requested. We may also share this information with others, but Personal Information will be shared only to fulfill your request or to facilitate your use of the information, features, products or services, or as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy. When sharing Personal Information in such a manner, we may also share your Internet Protocol (IP) address. In addition, we may use and share any registration information that you submit as set forth in the “Registration Information” section below.
				<br/><br/>

				We may use other companies and individuals (1) to perform supporting functions for the various tools, functionality, information, products and services offered through our Sites on our behalf, (2) to perform or support various tasks or initiatives instrumental to the business of, or related to operating or improving, the Sites or (3) to assist us in testing, maintaining or improving the features, content or effectiveness of the Sites or in performing research or development. These service providers may be permitted to receive from us and use information collected from you but will not be authorized by us to use Personal Information for any other purpose other than in connection with performing the support functions for Web Media or such other tasks, initiatives or assistance for Web Media. 
				<br/><br/>

				For information, features, products and services marketed or offered to you jointly or on a coordinated basis by us and a third party, Personal Information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. In these situations, Web Media will use Personal Information only to facilitate such information, features, products and services (or information about them) being made available to you or as outlined in this Privacy Policy, but the third party may use the information in different ways. You typically can tell when information, features, products or services are marketed or offered jointly or in coordination with a third party because a page or area of the Sites often will be "co-branded" in such cases, will display the third party's logo and/or name (whether or not along with our own), will describe or reference the relationship between Web Media and the third party or will be set up so that you can contact or be linked to the third party or its Web site to initiate, complete or learn more about the transaction. Please be aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding its use, sharing and protection of information about you and that such policies may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy.
				<br/><br/>

				User-Initiated Communication: From time to time, portions of the Sites may enable you to send email and other types of messages to us or to third parties and to participate in bulletin boards and discussion groups. All such emails and messages, and all such postings to bulletin boards and discussion groups, become our property once you submit them. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address may be included in any email that you send, whether to us or to third parties. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return. Also, remember that our bulletin boards and discussion groups are open to the public, and, therefore, your postings can be seen by anyone and are not protected by us or any other entity. Please use your own discretion when deciding whether and what to post and whom to contact. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to edit or delete postings from our bulletin boards and discussion groups. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.
				<br/><br/>

				Referrals: If you participate in any referral service we may offer as Consumers, we may use the information you submit to determine which of our participating Professional(s) may be able to serve your needs. We may forward information relating to you, which may include Personal Information obtained through our sign-up form or otherwise, to certain Professional(s). Those Professionals or their designees may contact you regarding your needs.  As Professionals, you might receive information from, or originating from, consumers seeking your products or services or related information. These information submissions or related inquiries or leads might include, without limitation, Personal Information. Because protecting personal privacy is important, we require that you treat data received from Web Media consumers as if it was still on the Sites and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may only use the information sent to you via our Sites for the purposes of providing the consumer products and/or services about which the consumer inquired. We require that you not make any other use of any such data and that you otherwise not share or transmit this information with or to any third party without the consumer’s consent.
				<br/><br/>

				Protection of rights: We will release Personal Information or other information we collect from you if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with legal process; (2) enforce the Terms of Use agreement for the applicable Site; (3) identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who are or we believe have caused or might cause injury to us or a third party, (4) defend or respond to claims brought or threatened against Web Media, its employees, directors, suppliers or service providers, Site users or others or (5) otherwise protect or assert the rights, property, interests or personal safety of Web Media, its employees, directors, suppliers or service providers, Site users or others. Any such release decisions may be made by us in our sole discretion. 
				<br/><br/>

				Asset transfers: We continue to develop our business and in doing so might choose to buy or sell businesses or assets. Personal Information and other information we collect from you is generally one of the assets acquired or transferred in such transactions.
				<br/><br/>

				Registration Information: The Personal Information you provide when you become a registered user or customer of one of the Sites is used primarily to help us customize or enhance your or others’ online experience, increase the convenience of accessing new or existing tools, products and services, and, if applicable, provide the information, features, products and/or services you purchase or request. This Personal Information may also be shared among the Sites to make use of the Sites more convenient by, for example, limiting the number of times you have to register with us. Your email address serves as a unique identifier in our record system, and together with your password is designed to help us prevent unauthorized access to information you choose to store on the Sites. The data you give us about your personal preferences and demographics (e.g., your age, ZIP code, occupation or the like) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate or other protected form (see “Information You Give Us,” above) or under confidentiality terms, with our current and potential advertisers and service providers so that they, or we, can present and deliver advertisements more effectively. 
				<br/><br/>

				Consumers: Unless you specify that you would prefer not to hear from us, we may use the email address you provide at the time of registration to contact you for promotional or other purposes. You may have these communications terminated at any time by opting out through your member profile on the applicable Site, or by clicking on any “unsubscribe” link contained in a promotional email. Please be aware that opting out on one of our Sites, does not opt you out from any of our other Sites unless that option is specifically provided. If you would like to request to opt out with respect to all of the Sites please email support@myrealtour.com with your requests.
				<br/><br/>

				Professionals: We may offer a newsletter, electronic flyer or similar material to keep you abreast of the products and services on the Sites or other professional products and services. Information such as your license number or personal financial information will not be shared with third parties except to complete a transaction or as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, information provided by you for the purposes of offering your products and services to others via one or more of the Sites will be shared with others, including consumers accessing one or more of the Sites. To the extent such information is necessary to offer such products and services it typically will be posted on the applicable Site(s). This may include, without limitation, your full name, email address, license number, state of license, address, phone number, graphic images and any other data intended to help consumers identify or contact you or related to your products or services.  When sharing Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we may also share your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
				<br/><br/>

				Non-personal Information: Automatically Gathered Information: Information that is automatically gathered, including through the use of cookies, may be shared among the Sites. It may also be shared with other third parties, including listing providers, advertisers, service providers and others, so that we may better understand how the Sites are used, to enhance the overall experience on the Sites and otherwise in connection with our operation of the Sites and conducting related business. But when so shared with third parties, any Personal Information will be included only if first put in aggregated or other protected form (see “Information You Give Us,” above) or the third party will be contractually restricted from using such Personal Information for any purpose other than in connection with the purpose for which it was shared by Web Media.
				<br/><br/>
				Children’s Privacy: Our Sites are general audience Web sites. If you are under the age of 13 you should not register or provide information on our Sites. We do not collect Personal Information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13. If you have knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has submitted Personal Information to us, please email support@myrealtour.com.
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<b>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY: OUTSIDE LINKS</b><br/>

				Be aware that our Sites link to other web sites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Sites, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices, nor the content, associated with any linked web site. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other web sites or contact the respective webmasters of those web sites to obtain information regarding their information collection, security, use and disclosure policies. 
				<br/><br/>


				<b>EFFECTIVE DATE AND MODIFICATIONS</b><br/>

				This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date first written above and may be updated and modified from time to time by us in our sole discretion. If we choose to update or modify this Privacy Policy, such updated or modified policy shall become effective five (5) business days after its posting on the applicable Site(s). Accordingly, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy and the Sites in order to keep apprised of our current privacy practices.
